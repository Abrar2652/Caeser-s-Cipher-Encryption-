# Caeser-s-Cipher-Encryption-
***This is a Python code which is based on an encryption function works like ciphertext= encryption( plaintext, key)
key means how many letters we have to shift. Here 0<=k<=25 considering there are 26 English Alphabets except other symbols or punctuations.
If you want to decrypt the code, just do the reverse of it i.e plaintext= decryption( ciphertext, key)***
